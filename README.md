# Task_5-Elevated_labs
I have imported panda and matplotlib
I have opened a csv file using read_csv()
I have used group_by to group the data on basis of the item
I used sum to add all the unit sold and their price and  revenue
Add all to a dataframe and plot those with Plot() as line
Then I have given lables and legends to display in the plot.
